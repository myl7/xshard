# Code in `preprocess/legacy`

Code in the directory is to do preprocessing over the XBlock dataset.
They are pretty raw and not well organized.
The final output is a CSV file with every transaction in a row.
The description here should even be easier to understand than the code itself.

But they can at least guide some complicated stuff, e.g., how to use the METIS dynamic library, and how to construct the graph data for the METIS library.
Hope they can be useful for your reimplementation.
